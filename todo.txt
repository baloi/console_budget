> calculate only a given period... (in budgetCalendar and in BudgetMonth)
  - TESTS FIRST
  - How to show a budget period/calendar 

> Figure out a way to have alerts in the budget program and how to
  time those alerts with receiving your salary 
> CalendarMonth.toHtml()

> create BudgetCalendar::calculate(date_from, date_to)
> read from a budget and
  - calculate expenses
  - be able to "space out" budget...
> refactor get_weeks method to make it smaller
  - make a common method to create a week
    . take note of what params to pass
  - try not to make any unwanted side effects to instance @ variables
    . assign intance variable explicitly "@my_var = init_my_var(val)"
> study how to use BudgetMonth and make an html calendar

> budget app plan (by 08/30/10)
  - edit directories and files by vim (no input from web..)
  - display data as webpage (only display, no input of data)
  - display data via console and may enter data by console

> Add dates for expenses and earnings
> regular earnings/expenses should be calculated for a month....
> debt management..

> refactor to: 
  - find proper names depending on class/method usage
  - make abstractions work (simplify or abstract more -- depends)
  - segregate to proper modules maybe
I need:
> to show a calendar for a given month
  - a method to return an array of weeks of the month
    . each week has 7 days with dates
  - a method to print calendar
> input owed, regular earned, expenses, planned payments
> show owed, earned and available, to save.... in dates at end of week
> show calendar with grids
Later:
> requiring files
> show budget status at current date???? --- maybe not

----- DONE -----
> budget calendar should use JADOF for persistence directory: ( 2010/august/29 )
> use rspec to test budget app
> backup your .ssh id's to big PC and to some device
> upload your first heroku app(blog) by wednesday 08/25/10 

> Implement Week initialization 8/16/10 , 1 am
> implement objMonth.weeks 
  - test of array/list of weeks in month are correct
    especially with beginning and end weeks (with padding)

> test specific days of week 8/17/10, 2 am
> classes for expenses, debt, earnings 8/21/10, 2 am
  - naming conventions: based on rails?
> add a calculate method (DONE) 9/13/2010 10:49 PM
